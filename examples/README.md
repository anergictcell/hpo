Here are some example binaries that either benchmark some expensive operations or produce some output to compare against `PyHPO`. I try to add the corresponding Python scripts as well, for comparison and reproducibility.

In order to run the binaries, you must download some master data from the [HPO](https://hpo.jax.org/) and save it to a subfolder `example_data`.
