def: "Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective)." [PMID:19125428]
comment: The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and\napplied inaccurately.

name: Thin upper lip vermilion

def: "Height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the midline more than 2 SD below the mean. Alternatively, an apparently reduced height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the frontal view (subjective)." [PMID:19125428]
comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or use the Likert scale for Caucasians and African Americans [Astley and Clarren, 2000]. The height of the vermilion of the upper lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thinness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to facial expression. On profile view, a thin vermilion is less convex than usual. A thin upper lip vermilion may be associated with a smooth philtrum and an absence of the Cupid's bow, but these should be assessed separately.
